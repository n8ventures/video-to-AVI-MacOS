0.4.0:
Bug:
Weird DnD error when it comes to having asksaveasfile in the code. Need to figure out how to fix it. One idea is via queue but we'll see.

New Features:
- Batch Mode
- Ability to choose a codec.
- Updated ffmpeg to 7.0.3

0.3.0:
Figure out batch mode.
- Batch mode is basically fast save mode, will save right next to original video.
- But I also do have to figure out how to set it to convert videos by batches.
