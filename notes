0.5.1:
- Fixed first entry not showing up on loading label.
- Disabled the ability to close converting popup to prevent app crashes.

0.5.0:
Figured out the bug. Thread was going on ahead and called in too many windows. added a print() just to stabilize it.

Also restoring DnD functions.
(Commenting out on_check just in case I need it again.)

- Fixed various TCL errors
- Added more codec options
- Fixed codec mispelling Quicktime Animation
- Fixed Label change on batch files
- Tweaked logic on saving video
    - Will ask which directory to save instead of individual files (This also prevents more tclerrors)
- removed useless code

0.4.0:
Bug:
Weird DnD error when it comes to having asksaveasfile in the code. Need to figure out how to fix it. One idea is via queue but we'll see.

New Features:
- Batch Mode
- Ability to choose a codec.
- Updated ffmpeg to 7.0.3

0.3.0:
Figure out batch mode.
- Batch mode is basically fast save mode, will save right next to original video.
- But I also do have to figure out how to set it to convert videos by batches.
